# UCI_Workshop

Introductory workshop describing why and how to use Simulink to help speed up the design process. 

## Agenda

In this session, you will learn how Simulink can be used to speed up your design process through modeling and simulation. Through live demonstrations and examples, you will see how Simulink can help you become more effective in your work. This session is targeted for those who are new to Simulink. However, experienced MATLAB/Simulink users may also benefit from the session.

**Highlights include:**

* Using Simulink in the engineering design process
* Real-world modeling using Simscape Electrical
* Interfacing and deploying to hardware (Arduino)
* Software development tips and tricks (configuration management, source control, report generation)
* Testing software
